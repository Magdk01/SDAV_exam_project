## Network Analysis of Global Trade

Our network analysis reveals the complex web of international trade relationships and how they've evolved over time. The visualization above shows key network metrics and relationships:

### Network Metrics

1. **Centrality Measures**
   - Degree centrality: Number of trading partners
   - Betweenness centrality: Role in facilitating trade
   - Eigenvector centrality: Influence in the network

2. **Community Structure**
   - Trading blocs and regional patterns
   - Strong vs. weak ties
   - Evolution of trade communities

### Key Findings

- **Power Shifts**: The changing positions of major trading nations
- **Regional Integration**: Formation and evolution of trading blocs
- **Network Resilience**: How the trade network responds to disruptions
- **Emerging Players**: Rise of new important nodes in the network
