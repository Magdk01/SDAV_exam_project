## Data Coverage and Quality

Our analysis begins with understanding the quality and coverage of the historical trade dataset. The visualization above shows several key aspects of our data:

- **Temporal Coverage**: The dataset spans from 1870 to 2014, with varying degrees of completeness
- **Missing Data**: We can observe patterns in missing data, particularly during major historical events
- **Data Sources**: Different sources contribute to our dataset, each with its own characteristics

### Key Findings

1. **Data Completeness**
   - Early years (1870-1900) have more sparse coverage
   - World Wars show significant data gaps
   - Post-1950 data is generally more complete

2. **Source Reliability**
   - Different sources are used throughout the timeline
   - Some sources provide more comprehensive coverage than others
   - Modern data (post-1950) tends to be more reliable
