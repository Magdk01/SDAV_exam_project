To visulize how the world's major economies have developed their export and import volumes over time, from the late 19th century to the present, we use visulizationb below. The data comes from bi-lateral trade records, where each country's trade flow is tracked in both directions — what it sends out (exports) and what it brings in (imports).

To make this data easier to explore, the graph includes two key features:

- A toggle between linear and logarithmic y-axis scaling that helps reveal different dynamics.

- A selectable country legend, where only the top five countries are shown by default to keep the view clean. You can click on others to add or remove them as needed.

One of the first insights that emerges when toggling to the logarithmic view is how consistently the global market has grown. The lines follow a remarkably steady and straight upward trend, indicating near-exponential growth in trade over the last century. This scale makes it easier to see patterns in the early years that would otherwise be compressed into a flat line in the linear view.

While the chart captures a global story, it focuses on teling the story between two especially important national ones: those of the United States and China.

The United States stands out as the world's dominant importer from the end of World War II onward. It maintained strong export levels throughout the 20th century but began importing more than it exported after around 1980, marking a long-term shift toward a trade deficit — a trend that has only grown more pronounced.

China, on the other hand, tells a very different story. For much of the early period, it remained a minor player in global trade. But starting in the late 1990s, and especially after joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China's export volume accelerated dramatically. Around 2010, it overtook the United States to become the largest exporter in the world. What's equally striking is that China's import volume also grew sharply, highlighting its emergence not just as a global manufacturing hub but also as a massive internal market.

These trends — the rise of China, the evolving role of the United States, and the consistent overall expansion of global trade — form the backbone of modern economic history, and this visualization provides a powerful way to explore them.

<strong>Note:</strong> You may notice that some countries, like Germany, briefly disappear from the chart. This is not an error but reflects historical events like World War II and the political division of countries, during which some ceased to exist in their previous form and thus weren't recorded under the same country code.
